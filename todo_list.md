# TODO

Moo magic mod idea:
Make a tile entity that allows you to move enchantments from tools to books
- there is a chance to lose enchantment levels or complete enchantments
- curses are **always** transferred
- chances of transferring get increased by copying said enchentments and also by studying books, inlcuding those enchantments
- movin over will never be 100% and max out before
- treasure enchantments are always either go all levels or nothing (for a specific enchantment)
- studying books gives more proficiency, returns empty books
- essences can increase efficiency of learning (for enchantment specific essence)
- mastering an enchantment allows to selectively remove only that ones

- [ ] Update project icon to new icon

## Goals

- make adding items, blocks and fluids as easy as possible
- making it configurable is optional, but would also make the mod more accessible for others (at least groups to enable disable might be a thought)

- also additional, optional, add a little bit of smithing mechanics
